## Overview
This project involves the creation of a Kubernetes cluster with Prometheus installed to monitor cluster, deployment, and pod metrics. A Go-based application checks the health of Kubernetes pods and nodes, with the ability to restart pods or alert when a node is nearing its resource limits. Additionally, an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Fluentbit) is set up to monitor and collect all application JSON logs.

## Architecture Diagram
(Include a diagram showing the Kubernetes cluster, Prometheus instance, the health-checking application, and the ELK stack, with their interactions.)

## Components
### 1. Kubernetes Cluster
- Provider: AWS/GCP/kind/minikube
- Basic cluster setup to host your applications

### 2. Prometheus
- Collects metrics from the cluster, deployments, and pods
- Basic configuration to scrape the metrics

### 3. Health-Checking Application
- Language: Go
- Utilizes the Go Kubernetes client package (OperatorSDK/controller-runtime)
- Constantly checks pod and node health using Prometheus metrics
- Restarts pods with specific errors and generates events if a node approaches resource limits
- Runs multiple instances to handle concurrency

### 4. ELK Stack (with Fluentbit)
- Collects JSON logs from Kubernetes pods
- Provides observability and monitoring of the application

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Provision Kubernetes Cluster
- Use AWS, GCP, or a local setup like kind/minikube
- Ensure the cluster is up and running

### 2. Install Prometheus
- Deploy Prometheus using Helm or manually apply manifests
- Configure Prometheus to collect cluster, deployment, and pod metrics

### 3. Deploy the Health-Checking Application
- Build the Go application using Go modules and packages
- Deploy using Kubernetes manifests (included in the `manifests` directory)
- Ensure the application is running multiple instances

### 4. Install ELK Stack
- Deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana in the Kubernetes cluster
- Set up Fluentbit to collect logs from the Kubernetes pods
- Verify that logs are ingested into Elasticsearch and visualized in Kibana

### 5. Testing the Setup
- Deploy a sample application (e.g., Nginx or a custom app) to the cluster
- Simulate pod errors and node resource limits
- Ensure the health-checking application responds appropriately (restarts pods, generates events)
- Check that logs are collected and displayed in Kibana

## Application Workflow
1. **Pod and Node Health Check:** The application periodically checks the health of pods and nodes using Prometheus metrics.
2. **Pod Restart:** If a pod encounters a specific error in its logs/events, the application restarts it.
3. **Node Alert:** If a node is nearing resource limits, the application queues an event for further action.
4. **Log Monitoring:** JSON logs from all pods are collected by Fluentbit and stored in Elasticsearch for monitoring via Kibana.

## Security Considerations
- Ensure Kubernetes secrets are managed securely (e.g., using Kubernetes secrets or a secret management tool).
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all Kubernetes roles and service accounts.
- Enable TLS for Prometheus and the ELK stack for secure communication.

## Best Practices
- Follow Go best practices, such as proper package structure, error handling, and concurrency management.
- Use appropriate design patterns, such as the singleton pattern for shared resources and factory patterns for object creation.
- Write meaningful commit messages to document progress and changes.
- Ensure scalability by designing the application to handle multiple instances and concurrent tasks.

## Conclusion
This project sets up a robust Kubernetes environment with health checks and monitoring capabilities using Prometheus, Go, and the ELK stack. The provided setup and application will help maintain high availability and reliability of services within the cluster.
